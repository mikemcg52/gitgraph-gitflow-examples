        <p>The Master branch is always in synch with Production.</p>
        <p>We create a Release branch for the new release work</p>
        <p class="hotfix">
            We may have the need to create hot fixes to deal with Production problems.
            These are branched off of Master.  When the hot fix is ready to push to Production this branch is
            merged back into master and deployed to Production.</p>
        <p class="hotfix-overlap">
            Multiple hot fixes may be worked on in parallel.
        </p>
        <p class="hotfix-overlap-backmerge">
            When this is the case we should do a "back merge" from
            master into the hot fix branch where we resolve any merge issues.  Once this is done, this branch can be
            merged into master and deployed to Production
        </p>
        <p class="feature-dev">
            Feature development can go on in parallel.  Each feature is worked on in its own branch.  When the feature
            is complete it can be merged into the release branch.  If there are questions about whether to include
            the feature in the release or not it should not be merged until those questions are resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-dev-backmerge">
            Multiple feature branches can be worked on in parallel.  When this occurs a "back merge" from the release
            branch to the feature branch should be done before generating a pull request to resolve any potential merge
            problems.
        </p>
        <p class="release2">
            If a new release needs to be worked on in parallel we create a new release branch.  This follows the same
            pattern in that we create feature branches and merge them back into the release branch
        </p>
        <p class="release-branch">
            When the release branch is ready for release the master branch should be "back merged"
            into the release branch to resolve any merge conflicts that may have arisen from hot fixes applied to master.
        </p>
        <p class="release-branch-release">
            While testing the release bug fixes may need to be applied.  These should be done on the release branch (
            a bug branch can be created here if the bug fix is complicated so as not to delay testing because of "work in
            progress".  Once the testing is complete the release branch is merged into master and the release pushed to
            production.
        </p>
        <p class="final-backmerge">
            At this point the release process for the next release (3.0.0) can begin.  This starts by merging master into
            the release branch, bringing in all of the changes added via hot fixes and in the 2.0.0 release.
