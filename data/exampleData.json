        "desc": "This is a typical 'GitFlow' example.  Feature and bug work are done on their own, dedicated branches.  For features, once a feature is determined to be stable and ready for integration testing it is merged into the development branch.  Feature branches should only be merged into development when the decision has been made to commit to including them in the next release.  Once a feature has been merged into the development branch reversing course and removing it from the release can be complicated and can introduce new opportunities for errors in the process.  Once all of the features are complete and development is stable a 'Release Branch' is created.  This branch is typically labelled consistently with the target release (i.e. Release/2.0.0).  We are using semantic versioning here <Major Release>.<Minor Release>.<Patch Level>.  Final work (bug fixes, typically) occurs on the Release branch until it is ready to push to production.  All released branches should be tagged in the repository for tracking purposes.  There are several points in this process where the Master or Release branch is 'back merged' into a working branch.  This is done to insure that testing proceeds against an accurate representation of the final, target environment, and to insure that changes to the target branch are not lost during the feature to target merge process.",
